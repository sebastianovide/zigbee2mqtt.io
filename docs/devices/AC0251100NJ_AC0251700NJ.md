## Notes


### Pairing
For the OSRAM Smart+ Switch Mini (AC0251100NJ/AC0251700NJ) hold the Middle and Arrow Down Buttons for 10 Seconds
to Reset the Device. Hold the Middle and Arrow Up Buttons for 3 Seconds to connect.
If the Switch is connected hold Middle and Arrow Up Buttons for 3 Seconds to disconnect.

After pairing, the Switch may broadcast its command. If that happen, you can try to [reconfigure it](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/mqtt_topics_and_message_structure.html#zigbee2mqttbridgeconfigure). If the configure fails, you may try to join and configure again being very closed to the coordinator. 

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).

## Manual Home Assistant configuration

    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:gesture-double-tap"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.action }}"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    device_class: "battery"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.battery }}"

    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
